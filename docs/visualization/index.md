# Data Visualization

Data visualization is one of the main reasons why we have to rely on GUIs. `magic-class`
has prepared some custom magic widgets (widgets that follow `magicgui` protocols) that
can directly used as components of your GUI.

- [`matplotlib`](matplotlib.md)
- [`pyqtgraph`](pyqtgraph.md)
- [`vispy`](vispy.md)
- [`vtk`](vtk.md)
