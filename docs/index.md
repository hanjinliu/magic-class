# magic-class

`magic-class` makes GUI development as easy as daily coding by converting well-typed
Python class directly into GUI. It is powered by [magicgui](https://github.com/pyapp-kit/magicgui)
and has a smooth interface with [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari).
`magic-class` is also implemented with useful widgets such as `matplotlib` figure
canvas, logger widget and color edit.
